1. Ensure you have **written authorization** from the system owner
2. Operate within the **scope** defined by the bug bounty program
3. Follow the target's **rules of engagement**
4. **Never** exfiltrate, modify, or destroy data

## Reporting Vulnerabilities

If you find a security issue in SecretPulse itself:

- Email: **support@secretpulse.sh**
- Include: version, steps to reproduce, impact assessment
